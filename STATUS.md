## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a clean modular structure:

- **`cnumpy.h`**: Complete API definitions
- **`cnumpy_core.c`**: Core tensor operations and memory management
- **`cnumpy_ops.c`**: Mathematical operations and activation functions
- **`cnumpy_scope.c`**: Name scoping, autodiff, and optimizers

## Usage Example

```c
#include "cnumpy.h"

int main() {
    cnp_init();
    
    // Create tensors
    size_t dims[] = {2, 3};
    cnp_shape_t shape = cnp_shape_create(2, dims);
    cnp_tensor_t *a = cnp_ones(&shape, CNP_FLOAT32);
    cnp_tensor_t *b = cnp_ones(&shape, CNP_FLOAT32);
    
    // Operations
    cnp_tensor_t *c = cnp_add(a, b);
    cnp_tensor_t *d = cnp_relu(c);
    
    cnp_print_tensor(d);
    
    cnp_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

The CNmpy implementation provides a solid foundation for a C-based tensor library with automatic differentiation capabilities. The basic tensor operations, activation functions, and computation graph building are working correctly. However, the automatic differentiation and memory management systems need debugging to create a fully functional machine learning library.

The codebase demonstrates the core concepts and architecture needed for a numpy-like library in C, making it suitable for educational purposes and as a starting point for more advanced implementations.
