- Some data structures have been renamed for clarity
- Memory management is now automatic with reference counting

**Build System**
- Makefile remains compatible for simple builds
- CMake support added for advanced features
- Cross-platform compatibility improved

**Example Migration**
```c
// Old API (0.x)
env_t *env = create_gridworld(4, 4);
agent_t *agent = create_dqn_agent(4, 2);

// New API (1.0)
cnp_rl_env_t *env = cnp_rl_gridworld_create(4, 4);
cnp_rl_agent_t *agent = cnp_rl_dqn_agent_create("DQN", 4, 64, 2, 0.001f, 1.0f, 0.01f, 0.995f, 0.99f);
```
